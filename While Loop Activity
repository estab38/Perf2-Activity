 random number between 1 and 10
let secretNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;

 user to guess the number
let guess =("5");

 Convert the guess to a number
guess = (guess)

 Use a while loop to keep asking until the user guesses correctly
while (guess !== secretNumber) {
   Check if the guess is too high or too low
  if (guess > secretNumber) 
    {console.log("Too high!");} 
  else 
  {console.log("Too low!");}

   Prompt the user to guess again
  guess = ("7");
  guess = parseInt(guess);}

 If the user guessed correctly, log a success message
console.log("Correct!");
